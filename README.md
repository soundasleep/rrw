### Getting started

`rake db:setup` will setup or reset the initial world.

`rake db:test:load test` will test the application with the data in `db/seeds.rb` (ignore the deprecation warning for now [from Rails 4.1+](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13528)).

### TODO

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
`rake doc:app`.
